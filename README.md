# amath

`amath` is a parser which converts [AsciiMath] to [MathML]. It uses the
[greg parser generator][greg]. It is written so it may be ported to
other languages easily, but can certainly be used as a library itself.

## Usage

AsciiMath is read and the equivalent MathML is printed.

	echo "x^2 + y^2 = z^2" | amath

The default behavior does not output any XML namespace.

* `--xml-ns` print with MathML XML namespace

## Installing

Use `make` to build and install `amath` and the shared library `libamath`.

	make
	make install

The unit tests can also be run from `make`.

	make test

The tests can be checked for memory leaks.

	make memory
